# Simplified-PageRank
# Description
This project was created to practice implementing an Adjacency List. The project is a simplified version of the well known PageRank algorithm used in Google search engines to rank webpages in order of importance. I implemented a simpler version of this using maps to represent my adjacency list. I four maps each storing different elements needed for the project such as the out degrees, in degrees, ranks, and unique URLs.
